// Instruction tell our programme what our programme should do.
/*Type of instruction:
1)Type declaration
2)Arithmetic instruction
3)Control instruction
*/
/*usage:
1)when we declare any variable we use 1st type of instruction
// valid statement;
c languge's code compile line by line

// in same line we can't use and declare varible 

so when we don't decalair variabal we can't use it.

we can declare multiple var in a single line



2)Arithmetic instruction
Arithmetic= when we perform action with oprends through operator
a + b here, a and b are operand and + is operator
value always asigine by R.H.S TO L.H.S
valid            ||       invalide  
a = b +c         ||        b+c =a
a = b *c         ||        bc =a
a = b /c         ||        a  = b^c*/
